# Unjustified 3D is not good
1. Using 3 dimensional view without need for using 3D is bad.
1. In 3d, if object is placed behind something, user needs to move head.

## Occlusion
* Something is located in front of other thing, blocking the object.
* It takes time to move view point.
* It takes time to interact and piece together.
* There is cognitive load, because user is memorizing what was previously and compare it.

# Planar spatial position is more effective than Depth
* According to Steven's psychophysical power law, length(position) is more powerful than depth.
