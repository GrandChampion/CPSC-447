# Case not to use 3D
1. Using 3 dimensional view without need for using 3D is bad.
1. In 3d, if object is placed behind something, user needs to move head.

## Occlusion
* Something is located in front of other thing, blocking the object.
* It takes time to move view point.
* It takes time to interact and piece together.
* There is cognitive load, because user is memorizing what was previously and compare it.

## Planar spatial position is more effective than Depth
* According to Steven's psychophysical power law, length(position) is more powerful than depth.

## Perspective distortion
* objects that are far from the viewer appear smaller than objects that are closer.
* perception accuracy is not used

## Never to use 3D bar chart
* 3D bar chart have perspective distortion and occlusion problem
* always use 2D bar chart

## Tilting text problem
* when the text is exactly on Image plane in 3D, if the box moves to tilted, then it is difficult to read the text.

# When to use 3D
* When user need to understand 3d object(shape perception)

# Case not to use 2D
* If there are lot of text, use 3D.

# Case to use 2D
* When topological structure is important.

# Eye beat memory
* Easy to compare moving eyes between views
* difficult to compare visible item to item that you just saw

# When is worth it for augmented reality(immersion)
* If data is spatial data, it is worth it to use AR.

# Creating overview help to guide to better design
* Make overview, then zoom, filter or detail the design based on demand

# Responsiveness
* 0.1 seconds needed for perceptual processing (Example: using mouse)
* 1 second: immediate response(Example: click mouse and wait)
* 10 seconds: brief task(Example: loading data)

# Consider functionality first
* focus on functionality first
* aesthetic is less important than functionality

# Basic graphic design
* proximity: group related items together
* alignment: left or right alignment
* repetition: make difference, if word repetes
* contrast: if concept is not identical, make it very different by using contrast.

# Labelling is good for user to understand
* label axis and use legend
